# Minesweeper
## Introduction
- The project will create a GUI version of the minesweeper game, using the turtle module.

## Features
1. Each run of the program randomly generates a minefield.
2. A left click on a square reveals white if there is no mine, red if there is a mine.
3. If a revealed square has no mine on it, it will specify the number of mines among its neighbors (if there are no neighboring mines, it'll show blank white)
4. A left click on a square that has no neighboring mines reveals not just that square, but all neighboring squares and doesn't stop until it reveals squares that do have neighboring mines.
5. A right click on an unrevealed square places a red "X" to mark a possible mine. Another right click takes the "X" off.
6. A yello "Reset" button will give a chance to play another game.
